## Introduction

The Movie Database (TMDB) is a community built movie and TV database. Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community dating back to 2008. TMDB’s strong international focus and breadth of data is largely unmatched and something we’re incredibly proud of Along with extensive metadata for movies, TV shows and people, we also offer one of the best selections of high resolution posters and backdrops. On average, over 1,000 images are added every single day.
